# Skyjacking
## A university project on simulated GPS spoofing
### Introduction
This repository contains the code developed for the S9 Capstone project at [ENAC](https://www.enac.fr/fr)  (Ecole 
Nationale de l'Aviation Civile).<br>
This academic project has the objective of developing a GPS spoofing system in a simulated environment.

### Objectives
The development of the software has been performed in accordance to the results of System Engineering activities
grounded in the following mission statement.

*The mission of the system to be developed is to allow the user (the attacker) to change the trajectory of an Unmanned 
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) by spoofing GPS messages. **The system will allow the user to define a desired trajectory and will 
generate the spoofed GPS messages needed to alter the target UAV's trajectory** and transmit 
them to it via a provided simulation interface.*
*The system to be developed will be limited in scope to the development of the software generating the spoofed GPS 
messages based on collected information. The system to be delivered will consist of software that allows to **achieve the 
given mission on a digital simulation of an UAV.** The interface provided by the simulation software is not dissimilar 
from that of a Software Defined Radio (SDR) System that could be deployed in a real operational scenario, and will 
therefore allow for development of a proof of concept for the Skyjacking tool. System engineering activities will be 
performed for the system to be developed. The simulator/SDR System is an external actor in this view.*
